Expected input is: referenceTree evaluationTrees targetTaxaCount
It analyses the input according to the taxa distribution over all trees and the relative rf distances of each gene tree to the reference tree. 
As a next step taxa are added to the reference tree to reach the target taxa count. new evaluation trees are build on the prior gaint statistics.
